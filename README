haplo-user-sync-uploader
========================

Current web home: https://github.com/sdsolle/haplo-user-sync-uploader

haplo-user-sync-uploader is a marvellous new Windows command-line utility for 
uploading, without all that tedious mucking about in powershell.

It can make zero or more file uploads with a given name argument, then 
optionally make another request to tell the haplo service to use the uploads. 

Certificates are tested properly, and it authenticates with HTTP Basic auth 
using the fixed username 'haplo' and a configured API key as a password.

It's compiled against .NET 2.0, so will run on /really/ ancient platforms if 
need be.


Configuration
-------------

At the windows command line, set the server name and API key as environment 
variables:

set HAPLO_SERVER=example.server.tld
set HAPLO_API_KEY=ABCD1234ABCD1234ABCD1234ABCD1234ABCD1234ABCD1234

[Note the absence of whitespace around the '=' sign. This is very
 important - Windows will happily use spaces in variable names!] 


Use
---

Syntax: haplo-user-sync-uploader command [name] [filename]

Examples:

haplo-user-sync-uploader file students path\to\students.tsv
haplo-user-sync-uploader file staff path\to\staff.tsv
haplo-user-sync-uploader apply

Possible errors returned:

 Missing command

 Missing or invalid filename

 The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request.
 Sync in unexpected state -- use admin interface to resolve.

 The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request.
 Last sync is not ready. Upload all the required files.


Building
--------

The utility was built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013.

It is deliberately configured to target .NET 2.0, meaning legacy platforms 
won't need a new framework installing, nor the obligatory restart that 
usually entails.

If you're in any double, confirm that the .csproj file has the appropriate 
reference to TargetFrameworkVersion of v2.0:

<PropertyGroup>
    <Configuration Condition=" '$(Configuration)' == '' ">
      Debug
    </Configuration>
    {blah blah â€¦}
    
    <TargetFrameworkVersion>v2.0</TargetFrameworkVersion>
